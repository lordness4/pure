# possible combinations of activating a conda env and running a script/program that requires the activated env

1. the dot method as a subprocess
. ~/bin/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate env && run your stuff!
caveat: does not work for env "dvf". Only for this one. Wtf? Apparently I could fix it by removing the "function" keywords within the scripts. Aha.Sure. The culprit is theano=1.0.3. If this package is installed, the activate script changes and somehow adds "function" to some scripts and it breaks. Magic. wtf?

1.1 THIS SHOULD BE THE SAME BUT IT ISNT!!!
source ~/bin/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate env && run your stuff
caveat: this gives me the "/bin/sh: 1: source not found" error we have in #3.

2. the simple activate method (as a subprocess)
conda activate env
caveat: does not work, due to "initialize your shell". Wtf?

3. using source activate env
source activate env
caveat: /bin/sh: 1: source: not found - I've got no idea why this is happening. Wtf?

4. using an activator script:
bash activator_script.sh env (e.g. plasflow) && plasflow
caveat: switches the environemnt (seen if I add an env list | grep "*" to the script) but "plasflow not found". If I add an ""&& env list" directly to the command, the env is not active anymore. Adding "-i" to the bash script does not change anything. Wtf?

5. change the first line of ~/bin/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh to a shebang line as suggest online
This does not do anything different than 3.

I think IVE GOT IT!
bash -c '. ~/blalba/conda.sh && conda activate && your command && conda deactivate'

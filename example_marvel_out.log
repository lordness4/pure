**Found phages in this sample!!!
**Bins predicted as phages and probabilities according to Random Forest algorithm:
*** bin.27 ->  85.61 %
*** bin.48 ->  83.54 %
*** bin.42 ->  88.95 %
**Finished Machine learning predictions!

**Bins predicted as phages are in the folder: ../../test_pure/o2/bins/contigs_deduplicated.fasta.metabat-bins10000/results/phage_bins/

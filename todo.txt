- make dvf run always, not only when the dvf env is active
- maybe create 4 conda envs:
  1. pure
  2. virome
  3. plasmidome
  4. dvf

- learn how to properly export a conda env
- learn how to switch conda envs from within python or a different way to use them

bigger things:
- include plasmidome tools
- write the cleanup functions
- write a setup function that checks for dependencies, installs stuff for virsorter, the models for dvf etc (optional, not my problem)
- write the report thingy


Calendar:
Thursday    -   include plasmidome tool
Friday      -   write report, with decision making
Saturday    -   check how to use conda properly
Sunday      -   write the cleanup stuff
Monday      -   port everything to ld-x and make it work over there
Tuesday     -   finishing touches, write README
